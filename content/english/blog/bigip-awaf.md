# 3. Protecting Against Common Web Application vulnerabilities

## 3.1 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common web application vulnerability that can lead to serious security issues. In this section, I will cover the definition and examples of XSS and how I can block these attacks using F5 BIG-IP Advanced WAF.

### Definition and Examples

#### What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a prevalent web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can hijack user sessions, steal sensitive information, or deface websites. Blocking XSS attacks is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of web applications.

#### Types of XSS

1. **Stored XSS**: The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database, comment field, or message board.
2. **Reflected XSS**: The malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message, search result, or other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server.
3. **DOM-Based XSS**: The vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code. The malicious script is executed as a result of modifying the DOM "environment" in the victim's browser.

#### Examples of XSS

##### Example 1: Stored XSS

An attacker submits a malicious script in a comment field of a blog. When other users visit the page, the script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing their cookies and session information.

```html
<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>
```
![Apply Policies](/images/blog/bigip/nonThumbnails/XSS-stored.gif)
##### Example 2: Reflected XSS

An attacker sends a crafted URL to a user. When the user clicks the link, the server reflects the attacker's script back to the user's browser, which then executes it.

```html
http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert('XSS Attack!');</script>
```

![Apply Policies](/images/blog/bigip/nonThumbnails/XSS-reflected.gif)
##### Example 3: DOM-Based XSS

An attacker manipulates the URL to include a malicious script, which the client-side code then processes and executes.

```javascript
document.write("Hello " + window.location.href.split("=")[1]);
```

### Blocking XSS Attacks

Blocking XSS attacks involves setting up the right security policies and configurations in F5 BIG-IP Advanced WAF. Here's how I do it:

#### Steps to Block XSS Attacks

1. **Enable XSS Protection**:
   - In the BIG-IP management interface, I go to 'Security' > 'Application Security' > 'Policies'.
   - I select the security policy I want to update.

2. **Configure Attack Signatures**:
   - **Navigate to Attack Signatures**: I go to 'Security' > 'Application Security' > 'Attack Signatures'.
   - **Enable XSS Signatures**: I enable signatures specifically designed to detect and block XSS attacks.
   
   | **Signature Name**        | **Description**                        |
   |---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
   | XSS Attack                | Detects general XSS attack patterns.   |
   | XSS in URL Parameters     | Detects XSS payloads in URL parameters.|
   | XSS in Form Inputs        | Detects XSS payloads in form inputs.   |

3. **Set Up Input Validation**:
   - **Navigate to Parameters**: I go to 'Security' > 'Application Security' > 'Parameters'.
   - **Add Parameter Rules**: I add rules for input validation, specifying allowed characters and patterns for parameters that might be vulnerable to XSS.
   
   | **Parameter Name** | **Allowed Characters** | **Validation Pattern**       | **Enforcement** |
   |--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
   | username           | Alphanumeric           | ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$               | Block           |
   | comment            | Alphanumeric + Symbols | ^[a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?]*$         | Alert           |
   | search             | Alphanumeric           | ^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$             | Block           |

4. **Output Encoding**:
   - I ensure that all data output to web pages is properly encoded to prevent execution of injected scripts.
   - This involves setting up the server and client-side code to use secure output encoding functions.

5. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - **Set Up CSP**: I configure a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
   - **Add CSP Header**: I add the CSP header to the server responses.

   ```plaintext
   Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
   ```

6. **Apply and Monitor**:
   - I apply these configurations and monitor the logs to ensure that XSS attacks are being detected and blocked effectively.
   - I regularly review and update the policies as needed based on new threats and patterns.

By following these steps, I can effectively block XSS attacks and protect my web application from one of the most common web vulnerabilities.

## 3.2 SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a critical security vulnerability that can have devastating consequences for web applications. Here's an in-depth look at SQL Injection, along with strategies for blocking these attacks.

### Definition and Examples

#### What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a type of attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into input fields of a web application, allowing attackers to manipulate the database and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Blocking SQL Injection attacks is essential for preventing data breaches and protecting the confidentiality of user data.

#### Types of SQL Injection

1. **In-band SQLi**: The attacker uses the same communication channel to both launch the attack and gather results. It includes techniques like error-based and union-based SQLi.
2. **Inferential SQLi**: The attacker sends payloads and observes the behavior and responses of the server to deduce information. It includes blind SQLi and time-based blind SQLi.
3. **Out-of-band SQLi**: The attacker uses different communication channels to send the attack and collect data. This is less common and relies on certain features being enabled on the database server.

#### Examples of SQL Injection

##### Example 1: Basic SQL Injection

An attacker enters `1' OR '1'='1'#` in a login form. If the application concatenates this input directly into an SQL query, it might become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '1' OR '1'='1' # ' AND password = '';
```

This query is always true and may return all user records.
![Apply Policies](/images/blog/bigip/nonThumbnails/sqli-basic.gif)
##### Example 2: Union-based SQL Injection

An attacker enters a payload like `, and 1=0 union select null, concat(first_name, 0x0a, lastname, 0x0a, user, 0x0a, password) from users #` which is designed to exploit a vulnerability in a web application's database query to retrieve sensitive information from the `users` table.

   {{< accordion "Understand the above given SQLi >>" >}}
The primary purpose of this SQL injection is to extract and display sensitive information from the `users` table. Specifically, it aims to concatenate and display the first names, last names, usernames, and passwords of all users in the table, separated by newlines.
1. **Basic Structure**:
   - The payload starts with `, and 1=0`. This part attempts to make the initial condition false (`1=0` is always false) to force the application to rely on the `UNION SELECT` part of the query.

2. **UNION SELECT**:
   - `union select null, concat(first_name, 0x0a, lastname, 0x0a, user, 0x0a, password) from users #` is used to combine the results of the existing query with the results of the injected query. 

3. **Concat Function**:
   - `concat(first_name, 0x0a, lastname, 0x0a, user, 0x0a, password)` combines the values from the specified columns of the `users` table. The `0x0a` represents a newline character (ASCII Line Feed), which means the values will be concatenated with a newline between each field.
     - `first_name` is the first name of the user.
     - `lastname` is the last name of the user.
     - `user` is the username.
     - `password` is the password.

4. **Null Placeholder**:
   - `null` is used as a placeholder for the first column in the `UNION SELECT` clause. This is because the number of columns in the `UNION SELECT` must match the number of columns in the original query. Since the original query likely selects multiple columns, `null` fills the gap for one of the columns.

5. **Comment Symbol**:
   - `#` is a comment symbol in SQL. Everything after `#` is ignored by the SQL parser, ensuring that the rest of the original query is not executed.
   {{< /accordion >}}

Here if the original query is something like this:

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM products WHERE category_id = 1;
```

After injection, it might become:

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM products WHERE category_id = 1 AND 1=0 UNION SELECT null, concat(first_name, 0x0a, lastname, 0x0a, user, 0x0a, password) FROM users;
```

Since `1=0` is always false, the `WHERE` clause will effectively discard the original query results. The `UNION SELECT` clause then retrieves and displays the concatenated `first_name`, `lastname`, `user`, and `password` from the `users` table.

   |--------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
   | username           | Alphanumeric           | ^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$               | Block           |
   | comment            | Alphanumeric + Symbols | ^[a-zA-Z0-9\s.,!?]*$         | Alert           |
   | id                 | Numeric                | ^[0-9]+$                     | Block           |

4. **Use Prepared Statements and Parameterized Queries**:
   - Ensure that the application code uses prepared statements and parameterized queries, which separate SQL code from data.

5. **Apply and Monitor**:
   - I apply these configurations and monitor the logs to ensure that SQL Injection attacks are being detected and blocked effectively.
   - I regularly review and update the policies as needed based on new threats and patterns.

## 3.3 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is another serious web application vulnerability. In this section, I'll define CSRF and explain how to protect against it using F5 BIG-IP Advanced WAF.

### Definition and Examples

#### What is Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)?

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to trick users into performing actions on a web application without their consent. By exploiting CSRF vulnerabilities, attackers can perform unauthorized transactions, change user settings, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim. Using CSRF protection mechanisms is vital for preventing these attacks and ensuring the integrity of user interactions with web applications.

#### How CSRF Works

An attacker tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request, typically by embedding a link or script in an email or on another website. When the user clicks the link or loads the script, the request is sent to the target web application with the user's credentials.

#### Examples of CSRF

##### Example 1: Changing Email Address

An attacker crafts a malicious URL that changes the victim's email address:

```html
<a href="http://example.com/change_email?new_email=attacker@example.com">Click here</a>
```

If the victim clicks the link while logged into the target site, their email address is changed without their consent.


##### Example 2: Transferring Funds

An attacker creates a form that submits a fund transfer request:

```html
<form action="http://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to_account" value="attacker_account">
  <input type="submit" value="Click to win a prize!">
</form>
```

If the user is logged into their bank account and submits the form, the funds are transferred to the attacker's account.

### Using CSRF Protection

# 12. WebSocket Protection

WebSocket protection secures WebSocket connections against attacks such as message tampering, injection, and DoS attacks.

## What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This means that data can be sent and received simultaneously, allowing for real-time communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. WebSockets are particularly useful for applications that require low latency and high-frequency updates, such as:

- **Chat Applications:** WebSockets allow for instant messaging and notifications without the need for repeated HTTP requests.
- **Live Feeds:** Real-time updates for stock prices, news, sports scores, etc.
- **Online Gaming:** Real-time communication between players and servers for multiplayer games.
- **Collaborative Platforms:** Real-time document editing and collaboration tools like Google Docs.

WebSockets start as an HTTP request, which is then "upgraded" to a WebSocket connection, allowing for persistent and efficient communication.

## WebSocket Protection Features

To ensure the security of WebSocket communications, it's essential to implement protection mechanisms that guard against various types of attacks, such as:

- **Message Tampering:** Ensuring that messages are not altered during transit.
- **Injection Attacks:** Preventing malicious data from being injected into WebSocket messages.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Mitigating attacks that aim to overwhelm the server with excessive requests.

#### Steps to Implement WebSocket Protection:

   |-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
   | Max Message Size            | Maximum size of WebSocket messages.                |
   | Connection Timeout          | Duration before idle connections are terminated.   |

   ```shell
   create websocket-profile max-message-size 1024 connection-timeout 60
   ```

3. **Apply WebSocket Profile to Virtual Server**:
   - Attach the WebSocket profile to the appropriate virtual server.

   | **Virtual Server**          | **WebSocket Profile**                              |
