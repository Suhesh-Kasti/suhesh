### Personal and Friends' Website Project:

I embarked on an exciting journey by crafting a website using Hugo, a static site generator. This project not only helped me gain proficiency in the Go programming language but also honed my skills in markdown. Beyond my personal site, I extended a helping hand to my friends, providing them with a web presence and a platform to share their ideas and work. This endeavor has been a remarkable combination of technical learning, creative expression, and community support.

### Project Requirements:

- Create and customize websites using Hugo, incorporating unique themes and imrpove functionalities.
- Start blogging about my learnings so it can be helpful for others as well.
- Develop content using markdown, optimizing the site's performance and user experience.
- Assist friends in establishing their web presence, tailoring sites to their individual needs.

### What I Learned:

Throughout this project, I've acquired a diverse set of skills and knowledge, including:

- Proficiency in Go programming, a versatile language for cyberseurity as well.
- Expertise in using markdown to structure and format content effectively.
- Understanding of static site generation and Hugo's capabilities.
- The ability to design and implement unique and functional websites.

### Experiences and Community Support:

This project has been a journey of both self-expression and community support. Through website creation, I've had the privilege of helping my friends establish their online presence and connect with their audience. It's a testament to the power of technology in bridging the digital divide and enhancing personal and professional opportunities.


### Learning Hosting and Domain Management:

In addition to web development, this project introduced me to the intricacies of website hosting and domain management. I've learned to host websites, gained insights into how domains work, and even obtained a .com.np domain. Exploring Cloudflare Pages further enriched my knowledge, teaching me about DNS, CNAME records, and the importance of security concepts like HTTP TLS.
