---
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful and widely-used open-source network scanning and security auditing tool designed to discover devices, services, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities on computer networks. 

Every hacking starts with enumeration and reconnaissance phase. Enumeration is a crucial step in the information-gathering process when assessing the security of a network or system. During this phase, the goal is to gather as much information as possible about the target network or system to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses. 

In this blog post we are going to go over the following topics:
- #####  Installing Nmap
	- ###### [Nmap on Windows](#windows)
	- ###### [Nmap on Linux](#linux)
	- ###### [Nmap on macOS](#macos)
	- ###### [Some alternatives for Android and IOS](##androidnios)

# Install Nmap   
<br>

### Windows

Windows users can download the official Nmap installer from the [Nmap's website](https://nmap.org/download.html) and follow the installation wizard. Make sure to add Nmap to your system's PATH for convenient command-line access.

Nmap can also be installed in windows using winget. Open powershell and type the following the following command:
``` ps1
winget install -e --id Insecure.Nmap
```

<br>

### Linux

On Linux, the installation process is as straightforward as it can get. Just open the terminal and use the package manager according to the distribution:

###### For Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

###### For Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora:

```bash
sudo dnf install nmap
```

###### For Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S nmap
```

<br>

### macOS

macOS users can use the Homebrew package manager for a hassle-free installation:
```bash
brew install nmap
```
<br>

### Alternatives for Android and iOS

While Nmap is primarily designed for desktop and server environments, if an android or iOS is all that you've got don't worry I got you. Here are some alternatives you can use:

###### Android:

1. **[Fing Network Tools:](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.overlook.android.fing&pli=1)** Fing is a nice and user-friendly app that can help you discover devices on your network, check their connectivity, and perform basic network enumeration.
2. **[Termux:](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)** Advanced users can install Termux, a terminal emulator for Android, and then install Nmap within it to use Nmap. Termux is basically linux at your fingertips. In termux to download nmap you can use the command:

```bash
pkg install nmap
```

###### iOS:

1. **[iNetTools:](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/inettools-ping-dns-port-scan/id561659975)** iNetTools offers a set of network diagnostic tools, including ping, traceroute, and port scanning, for iOS users.
2. **[Termius:](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/termius-terminal-ssh-client/id549039908)** Similar to Termux on Android, you can use the Termius app on iOS to run Nmap commands within a terminal environment. This is what google search said as I haven't used iOS yet.

# Let's start using Nmap

1. **-sC** (Script Scanning):
    
    - **Description:** Enables script scanning using Nmap's default scripts to discover vulnerabilities and perform additional reconnaissance.
    - **Example:** `nmap -sC 192.168.1.252`
2. **-sT** (TCP Connect Scan):
    
    - **Description:** Performs a basic TCP connect scan by establishing a full TCP connection to the target ports.
    - **Example:** `nmap -sT 192.168.1.253`
3. **-sV** (Service Version Detection):
    
    - **Description:** Attempts to identify the version of services running on open ports.
    - **Example:** `nmap -sV 192.168.1.254`
4. **-p-** (Scan All Ports):
    
    - **Description:** Scans all 65535 ports on the target. By default, Nmap only scans the 1000 most common ports.
    - **Example:** `nmap -p- 192.168.1.253`
5. **-T5** (Aggressive Timing):
    
    - **Description:** Sets the timing template to "Aggressive," which makes the scan faster but more intrusive.
    - **Example:** `nmap -T5 192.168.1.252`
6. **-v vs -vv** (Verbose Output):
    
    - **Description:** Controls the level of verbosity in the output. `-v` provides regular verbosity, while `-vv` increases verbosity.
    - **Example:** `nmap -v 192.168.1.254`
7. **-Pn** (No Ping):
    
    - **Description:** Skips host discovery and assumes that the target is up, regardless of whether it responds to pings.
    - **Example:** `nmap -Pn 192.168.1.253`
8. **-O** (OS Detection):
    
    - **Description:** Attempts to identify the operating system of the target hosts.
    - **Example:** `nmap -O 192.168.1.252`
9. **-sU** (UDP Scan):
    
    - **Description:** Initiates a UDP scan to discover open UDP ports and services.
    - **Example:** `nmap -sU 192.168.1.254`
10. **-A** (Aggressive Scan):
    
    - **Description:** Enables an aggressive scan, which includes OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
    - **Example:** `nmap -A 192.168.1.253`


Running aggressive scans, such as `-T5` and `-A`, may generate more network traffic and could potentially be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or firewall rules. Always ensure you have the necessary permissions and authorization before scanning any network or system.
