## Welcome to this [DNS Series üåê](/tags/dns/)

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type a URL like `suhesh.com.np` in your browser and hit Enter? What magic makes it possible for websites, hosted halfway across the globe, to load in seconds? The answer lies in **DNS**‚ÄîDomain Name System‚Äîthe _"contacts app"_ of modern Internet.

Through this blog series we will walk through a exploration of DNS, from its foundational concepts to setting up your own **F5 DNS** solutions learning together along the way. I am aiming this series to:

- Break down the complexities of DNS in an intuitive and engaging way.
- Incorporate hands-on lab walk alongs to solidify our understanding.
- Include quizzes and practical exercises to exercise what we learnt.
- Make this learning journey fun and rewarding!

Let‚Äôs begin this adventure by understanding the basics. In the upcoming posts, we‚Äôll dive deeper into DNS records, security (like DNSSEC), tools such as `dig` and `nslookup`, and even scaling DNS using advanced features.

# What is DNS? üõ†Ô∏è

Imagine if every website required you to memorize its IP address‚Äîlike remembering the coordinates of a friend's house instead of their name. This is where DNS comes in....

### **DNS in a Nutshell**

DNS is often called "the internet‚Äôs phonebook." It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `suhesh.com.np`) into IP addresses (`104.21.25.25`) that machines can understand. Without it, navigating the internet as we know it, would be impossible.

### **Why is DNS Important?**

Here are a few reasons DNS is a cornerstone of the internet:
| Aspect | Role |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accessibility** | Simplifies the process of connecting to web resources. |
| **Scalability** | Powers billions of devices across a dynamic, growing internet. |
| **Security** | Modern DNS incorporates protections like DNSSEC to counter threats. |
| **Flexibility** | Enables content delivery systems, load balancing, and more. |

### **A Fun Analogy**

Think of DNS as your favorite librarian. You walk in and ask for a book (domain name). The librarian knows exactly which shelf and row to find it (IP address). This system ensures you never get lost in the vast "library" of the internet.

## How Does DNS Work? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Let‚Äôs peek under the hood of a DNS lookup. When you search for `suhesh.com.np`:

1. Your browser contacts a **recursive resolver** (usually provided by your ISP).
2. The resolver queries the **root servers** to find which TLD (e.g., `.com.np`) servers it should ask next.
3. It moves to the **TLD nameservers** to locate authoritative servers for `suhesh.com.np`.
4. The resolver retrieves the IP address from the authoritative server and returns it to your browser.
5. Your browser connects to the resolved IP address, and voil√†, the site loads!

Here‚Äôs a visual representation of the process:  
{{< accordion "What are all these jargons?" >}}  
We will be having a look at all of these with proper example so if you understand nothing **don't worry**.

- **Recursive Resolver:** Acts as the middleman.
- **Root Servers:** Directs the query to the appropriate TLD server.
- **TLD Servers:** Knows which authoritative servers hold the records.
- **Authoritative Servers:** Provides the actual IP address.

## The Bigger Picture üñºÔ∏è

Every online activity‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs streaming Netflix, sending emails, or chatting on Telegram‚Äîit depends on DNS. It enables:

- **Seamless communication** between human-friendly URLs and the IP-based networking world.
- **Scalability and performance** for businesses using global content distribution.
- **Improved security** using techniques like **GeoDNS** and **DNSSEC.**

## What‚Äôs Next?

In the upcoming posts, we‚Äôll dig deeper into:

- **DNS Records**: A closer look at A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, and other record types.
- **Setting Up Your Own DNS Server**: Get hands-on with BIND and F5 DNS configurations.
- **DNS Security**: How to use DNSSEC and manage zone files securely.
- And much more‚Ä¶

This is just the tip of the iceberg! Gear up to get your hands dirty as we will combine technical knowledge with practical labs to **master DNS inside-out**.
