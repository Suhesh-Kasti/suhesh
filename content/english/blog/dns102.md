## How Does DNS Work? üåê

Every time we visit a website, our system undertakes an invisible yet intricate process to resolve the domain into an IP address. Let‚Äôs follow the journey of a domain query, using `suhesh.com.np` as our example.

### Some jargons I will use below

{{< tabs >}}  
{{< tab "Stub Resolver" >}}

A **stub resolver** is the simplest DNS client‚Äîusually built into your operating system. It‚Äôs responsible for:

- Sending a query to an LDNS server.
- Receiving the resolved IP.
- Storing the result temporarily in your device‚Äôs local DNS cache.

Example: Your PC or smartphone is using a stub resolver when querying `suhesh.com.np`.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Recursive Resolver" >}}

A **recursive resolver** handles the heavy lifting in the DNS process. It:

- Acts on behalf of the stub resolver to locate the requested IP address.
- Queries multiple DNS servers (root, TLD, authoritative).
- Caches responses to speed up subsequent lookups.

Example: Google‚Äôs **8.8.8.8** or your ISP‚Äôs DNS server.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Authoritative Server" >}}

An **authoritative server** holds the definitive information about a domain.

- Stores DNS records for domains it manages.
- Responds with the appropriate IP address or relevant record for a query.

Example: Cloudflare‚Äôs authoritative server for `suhesh.com.np` knows the exact IP (`172.67.222.11`).

{{< /tab >}}  
{{< /tabs >}}

### The Journey of a Domain Query üöÄ

When you type `suhesh.com.np` into your browser, the DNS resolution journey looks like this:

##### 1. **Local Check:**
<br>
{{< tabs >}}  
{{< tab "Host File" >}}  
Your **PC** first checks its local `hosts` file.

#### Where is the hosts file located?

- Windows: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
- Linux/Unix: `/etc/hosts`

There domain to IP can be mapped as follows so that the IP is used directly.
![Host file](/images/blog/dns/hosts_file.png)

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "DNS Cache" >}}  
If there is no entry for the domain in the hosts file then your PC checks it's operation system's **local DNS cache** for a cached record to avoid querying a server.

_Sites are cached when you visit the site for a certain time(TTL) so that querying the server is not required._

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Network gateway's Cache" >}}  
If there is no entry for the domain locally cached in the PC as well then the DNS cache of your network gateway(router) is searched for a cached record to **avoid querying a server**.

_Sites are cached when you visit the site for a certain time(TTL) so that querying the server is not required._

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}
<br>

##### 2. **Querying LDNS:**
   - If the IP is not found locally, your system queries the **Local DNS Server (LDNS)**. But what is an LDNS?

{{< tabs >}}  
{{< tab "ISP" >}}  
When you use your **Internet Service Provider's (ISP)** DNS server, your device typically sends all DNS queries to this server by default.

### Example Scenario:

- **Setup:** Your router has a default DNS server IP like `192.168.1.1`, which points to the ISP's DNS server.
- **Query Path:** The DNS request for `suhesh.com.np` is forwarded to the ISP's DNS server. If the ISP's server has the record cached, it responds immediately; otherwise, it follows the recursive resolution process.

```bash
# Check your device's DNS
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

#### Pros:

- No additional setup required.
- Often optimized for local ISPs‚Äô networks.

#### Cons:

- May lack privacy protections.
- Slower or less reliable compared to public options.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Public" >}}  
Public DNS servers are reliable, fast, and often provide added features.

##### Examples of Popular Public DNS Servers:

| **Provider**       | **Primary DNS** | **Secondary DNS** | **Features**                       |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Google DNS**     | 8.8.8.8         | 8.8.4.4           | Reliable and globally distributed. |
| **Cloudflare DNS** | 1.1.1.1         | 1.0.0.1           | Fast and privacy-focused.          |
| **AdGuard DNS**    | 94.140.14.14    | 94.140.15.15      | Blocks ads and trackers.           |

##### Use Case:

You switch to **Cloudflare‚Äôs 1.1.1.1** to improve website load speed and ensure your DNS queries aren‚Äôt logged by the ISP.

###### Changing DNS Settings (Linux):

```bash
sudo nmcli dev show | grep 'IP4.DNS' # Show current DNS
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf # Modify DNS
```

##### Pros:

- Speed and reliability.
- Advanced features like ad blocking (AdGuard) or better privacy (Cloudflare).

##### Cons:

- Dependency on external entities.
  {{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "On-Premise" >}}  
On-premise DNS servers offer control and security, often used by organizations or enthusiasts.

### Corporate Use Case:

Businesses often host DNS servers internally to:

- Ensure faster name resolution within the company‚Äôs network.
- Control and monitor employee DNS requests for security purposes.

#### Pros:

- Full control over DNS records.
- Customization for specific network needs.

#### Cons:

- Requires technical expertise and maintenance.
- Higher setup costs.

{{< accordion "DIY Example: Pi-Hole on Raspberry Pi" >}}
We can set up a **Pi-Hole** server on a Raspberry Pi at home to block ads and trackers for all devices on our network.
#### Configuration:

- Raspberry Pi runs as a DNS server at `192.168.1.2`.
- All devices on the network point to this server for DNS queries.

```bash
# Installing Pi-Hole
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

{{< /accordion >}}

{{< /tab >}}  
{{< /tabs >}}
<br>
##### 3. **Recursive Resolution:**

   - If the LDNS doesn‚Äôt have the record in its cache, it acts as a **recursive resolver**, initiating the process of finding the IP.
   - It starts at the **[root DNS servers](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers)**, managed by 13 authorities using an <abbr title="A network that uses a single IP address for multiple devices in different locations.¬†Anycast networks use routing protocols to direct traffic to the closest endpoint.">anycast network</abbr>, directing queries to the nearest available server.  
     _Note:_ The root servers *sort of operate in a "I know a person who knows a person" kind of situation*. They  doesn‚Äôt know the final IP but points to the recursive resolver to nameservers managing the Top Level Domain(TLD) server. 

##### 4. **TLD Nameservers:**
   - The `.com.np` TLD, managed by **Mercantile**, provides the IP for the **nameservers** responsible for `suhesh.com.np`.

**Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers** are a crucial part of the **Domain Name System (DNS)**. When a recursive resolver queries the root server for a domain name, the root server responds with the address of the TLD server responsible for that domain‚Äôs TLD (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.in`).

**TLD Servers** maintain the list of authoritative name servers for domains under their specific TLD. These servers help in the resolution process by directing the query to the correct authoritative server for a domain.

{{< tabs >}}  
{{< tab "Generic TLDs (gTLDs)" >}}

Generic TLDs are the most common and widely used domain extensions, often associated with their initial use cases (e.g., `.com` for commercial, `.org` for organizations).
##### **Examples:**

- **Traditional gTLDs:** `.com`, `.net`, `.org`
- **Modern gTLDs:** New gTLDs introduced to accommodate the demand for domain names, such as:
    - **Tech-related:** `.io`, `.tech`
    - **Community-based:** `.club`, `.shop`
    - **Fun and niche:** `.gg`, `.zip`, `.xyz`
##### **Uses of gTLDs:**

- **.com**: Most popular, used for businesses or general-purpose websites.
- **.org**: Typically used by nonprofits and organizations.
- **.io**: Common among startups and tech-focused sites.
- **.gg**: Popular in the gaming community.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Country Code TLDs (ccTLDs)" >}}

Country code TLDs represent specific countries or territories. They are assigned based on the **ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes**.

##### **Examples:**

- **United States:** `.us`
- **India:** `.in`
- **Nepal:** `.com.np`

##### **Uses of ccTLDs:**

- Localization of services and products for specific countries.
- Trust-building among local users (e.g., businesses in Nepal prefer `.com.np` for local recognition).

##### **Fun Fact:**

Some ccTLDs, though country-specific, are widely used globally because of their uniqueness or relevance. For instance:

- **.me (Montenegro):** Often used for personal blogs or profiles.
- **.tv (Tuvalu):** Popular among video or streaming services.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab "Sponsored TLDs (sTLDs)" >}}

These are a subset of gTLDs managed by specific organizations and are restricted to certain purposes.

##### **Examples:**

- **.gov:** Restricted to US government entities.
- **.edu:** Reserved for accredited educational institutions.
- **.mil:** Used exclusively by the US military.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "Infrastructure TLDs" >}}

An example is **.arpa**, which is reserved for technical infrastructure purposes, such as reverse DNS lookups.

{{< /tab >}}  
{{< /tabs >}}
<br>
##### 5. **Authoritative Nameservers:**
   - The query reaches **Cloudflare‚Äôs authoritative nameservers**, where a <abbr title="A text file that stores information about a DNS zone.¬†It's a collection of records for all the domains in that zone.">zone file</abbr> maps `suhesh.com.np` to its IP (` 172.67.222.11`). This is sent back to the resolver.

##### 6. **Response to the User:**
   - The IP (`172.67.222.11`) is sent back through the resolver to your browser, which establishes a connection to load the website.

*Note: Since the user receives answer back from the recursive resolver, the issue of <abbr title="A network communication scenario where a packet travels from a source to a destination using one path, but takes a different path when returning to the source.">asymmetric routing</abbr> doesn't occur*

---

### Understanding Zone Files üìÑ

A **zone file** is like the rulebook for a domain, that contains the mapping between domain names and IP addresses, along with other records. Zone files are managed by authoritative name servers and are essential for DNS functionality. Each zone file defines a **DNS zone**, which represents a portion of the DNS namespace.

A zone file is structured in **Resource Record (RR) format**, consisting of several records that define how a domain and its subdomains are handled. It starts with a **Start of Authority (SOA) record**, followed by various resource records such as **A**, **AAAA**, **PTR**, **MX**, **CNAME**, **TXT**, and others.

{{< accordion "An Example Zone file" >}}

```dns
$TTL 86400       ; Default Time to Live for zone data
@   IN  SOA ns1.suhesh.com.np. admin.suhesh.com.np. (
        2025011501 ; Serial (YYYYMMDDNN format)
        3600       ; Refresh interval
        1800       ; Retry interval
        1209600    ; Expiry interval
        86400      ; Minimum TTL
)

; Name Server Records
@       IN  NS   ns1.suhesh.com.np.
@       IN  NS   ns2.suhesh.com.np.

; A Records (IPv4 address mapping)
@       IN  A    192.0.2.1                ; Root domain IPv4
www     IN  A    192.0.2.2                ; Subdomain for web
mail    IN  A    192.0.2.3                ; Subdomain for mail server

; AAAA Records (IPv6 address mapping)
@       IN  AAAA 2001:0db8::1             ; Root domain IPv6
www     IN  AAAA 2001:0db8::2             ; Subdomain for web (IPv6)

; PTR Records (Reverse DNS)
1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR suhesh.com.np. ; IPv4 reverse lookup
3.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR mail.suhesh.com.np. ; Mail server reverse lookup

; CNAME Records (Aliases)
www     IN  CNAME suhesh.pages.dev.       ; Alias for hosted site
suhesh.com.np. IN  CNAME suhesh.pages.dev.

; MX Records (Mail Exchange)
@       IN  MX   10 mail.suhesh.com.np.   ; Primary mail server
@       IN  MX   20 backup-mail.example.com. ; Backup mail server

; TXT Records (Text and Verification)
@       IN  TXT  "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ~all"  ; SPF record
@       IN  TXT  "This is a test TXT record for suhesh.com.np"
_dmarc  IN  TXT  "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@suhesh.com.np"

```

 {{< /accordion >}}
{{< accordion "Explanation of the above Example" >}}
- **SOA Record**:
    
    - `ns1.suhesh.com.np.`: Primary name server.
    - `admin.suhesh.com.np.`: Administrative contact email (`admin@suhesh.com.np`, replacing the first `.` with `@`).
    - Timings specify refresh, retry, expiry, and default TTL.
- **A Records**:
    
    - Root domain (`@`) points to `192.0.2.1`.
    - `www.suhesh.com.np` resolves to `192.0.2.2`.
- **AAAA Records**:
    
    - IPv6 equivalents of the A records.
- **PTR Records**:
    
    - `192.0.2.1` resolves to `suhesh.com.np` for reverse DNS lookups.
    - Reverse lookups ensure IP addresses can be mapped to hostnames.
- **CNAME Records**:
    
    - `www.suhesh.com.np` is an alias for `suhesh.pages.dev`.
    - `suhesh.com.np` is also an alias, facilitating hosting on Cloudflare.
- **MX Records**:
    
    - Specifies two mail servers for redundancy.
    - Preference is determined by the **priority value** (lower number = higher priority).
- **TXT Records**:
    
    - SPF ensures only IPs in `192.0.2.0/24` can send emails on behalf of the domain.
    - `_dmarc` specifies a DMARC policy to monitor mail authentication.

## Some Common DNS Records  üõ†Ô∏è
{{< tabs >}}

{{< tab "SOA (Start of Authority)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **SOA record** is a mandatory record in DNS zone files and defines authoritative information about the domain. It specifies the primary DNS server, email address of the admin, and timing settings for refreshing zone data.

**Example:**

```dns
@   IN  SOA ns1.suhesh.com.np. admin.suhesh.com.np. (
        2025011501 ; Serial number
        3600       ; Refresh interval (1 hour)
        1800       ; Retry interval (30 mins)
        1209600    ; Expiry interval (14 days)
        86400      ; Minimum TTL (1 day)
)
```

**Breakdown:**

- **Primary DNS server:** `ns1.suhesh.com.np.` indicates the primary nameserver.
- **Admin email:** `admin.suhesh.com.np.` translates to `admin@suhesh.com.np`.
- **Serial:** Updates sequentially for tracking changes (format: YYYYMMDDNN).
- **Timing values:** Control how often other servers sync zone data.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "A (Address)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **A record** maps a domain name to an IPv4 address. It‚Äôs the most common record used for name-to-address resolution.

**Example:**

```dns
@   IN  A 192.0.2.1
www IN  A 192.0.2.2
```

**Breakdown:**

- `@`: Represents the root domain (`suhesh.com.np` in this case).
- `www`: Resolves the `www.suhesh.com.np` subdomain to `192.0.2.2`.
- **Usage:** Critical for websites, APIs, or any service running on an IPv4 address.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "AAAA (IPv6 Address)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **AAAA record** is like the A record but maps domain names to IPv6 addresses.

**Example:**

```dns
@   IN  AAAA 2001:0db8::1
www IN  AAAA 2001:0db8::2
```

**Breakdown:**

- `@`: Maps the root domain to `2001:0db8::1`.
- **Why IPv6?** IPv4 has limited addresses; IPv6 expands the pool massively.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "CNAME (Canonical Name)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **CNAME record** creates an alias, redirecting one domain name to another without associating directly with an IP address.

**Example:**

```dns
www     IN  CNAME suhesh.pages.dev.
suhesh.com.np. IN  CNAME suhesh.pages.dev.
```

**Breakdown:**

- `www.suhesh.com.np` is an alias for `suhesh.pages.dev`.
- This allows updates to be managed centrally on `suhesh.pages.dev`.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "MX (Mail Exchange)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **MX record** directs email for a domain to a mail server. **Priority** determines the order mail servers are tried.

**Example:**

```dns
@   IN  MX   10 mail.suhesh.com.np.
@   IN  MX   20 backup-mail.example.com.
```

**Breakdown:**

- `Priority 10`: Mail server `mail.suhesh.com.np` has the highest priority.
- `Priority 20`: Backup server `backup-mail.example.com`.
- **Tip:** Lower priority number = Higher priority.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "PTR (Pointer)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **PTR record** is used in reverse DNS. It maps an IP address to a domain name for validation purposes.

**Example:**

```dns
1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR suhesh.com.np.
```

**Breakdown:**

- The IP `192.0.2.1` maps to `suhesh.com.np`.
- Commonly used for verifying email sender authenticity.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "SRV (Service)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **SRV record** specifies a service‚Äôs location, including protocol, port, and priority.

**Example:**

```dns
_service._tcp.suhesh.com.np. IN SRV 10 5 5060 sip.suhesh.com.np.
```

**Breakdown:**

- `_service`: Service name (e.g., `_sip` for VoIP).
- `_tcp`: Protocol used.
- `10`: Priority (lower is preferred).
- `5`: Weight (higher gets more traffic).
- `5060`: Port for the service.

{{< /tab >}}  

{{< tab "TXT (Text)" >}}

**Description:**  
The **TXT record** stores text data for verification or metadata purposes, such as SPF, DKIM, and site ownership verification.

**Example:**

```dns
@       IN  TXT  "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ~all"
_dmarc  IN  TXT  "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@suhesh.com.np"
```

**Breakdown:**

- **SPF:** Ensures only IPs in `192.0.2.0/24` can send mail.
- **DMARC:** Policy for email authentication reporting.

{{< /tab >}}  
{{< /tabs >}}


{{< accordion "And finally, some more commonly used DNS jargons" >}}

### **Registrar**

Before you can start using the DNS service, you must first have a domain. This is achieved by using a service called **registrar**. A registrar handles the reservation of domain names.

Very often the same company that offers domain registration also offers web hosting and DNS management.

---
### **Resource Record Sets (RRSETs)**

  An RRSET is a group of resource records with the same name, class, and type but possibly different data.  
  For example, if you have multiple `A` records for load balancing:
```dns
  www.suhesh.com.np. IN A  104.21.25.25
  www.suhesh.com.np. IN A  172.67.222.11
```

This group forms an RRSET.

- **Importance:**  
    Ensures all records of the same type for a specific domain are returned together, preventing incomplete or ambiguous answers.

---

### **DNS Delegation**

- **What Is It?**  
    DNS delegation is the process of assigning responsibility for a subdomain to another DNS server.  
    To delegate a subdomain such as¬†*delegated.suhesh.com.np*, tell DNS resolvers where to find the zone file:
    For example:
    
    - The root server delegates `.com` to Verisign (the registry for `.com` TLD).
    - Verisign delegates `suhesh.com.np` to Cloudflare 
    
- **Why Use Delegation?**
    - Scales DNS by distributing the management of subdomains.
    - Example setup: A company managing `example.com` might delegate `sales.example.com` to a separate department or team.

---

### **TTL (Time to Live)**

- **Definition:**  
    TTL is a duration (in seconds) that tells resolvers how long to cache a record before requesting an update.
    
- **Use Case:**
    
    - **Short TTLs:** Good for dynamic content, as changes propagate faster.
    - **Long TTLs:** Better for static services, reducing DNS server load.
- **Example:**
    
    ```dns
    www.suhesh.com.np. IN A 192.0.2.1 3600
    ```
    
    Here, the TTL is `3600` seconds (1 hour).
    

---

### **Zone Delegation**

- **How It Works:**
    
    - Parent zones (like `.com.np`) maintain NS records pointing to child zones (e.g., `suhesh.com.np`).
    - These NS records specify the authoritative servers for the child zone.
- **Example Delegation Setup:**  
    Parent zone `com.np` might include:
    
    ```dns
    suhesh.com.np. IN NS ns1.cloudflare.com.
    suhesh.com.np. IN NS ns2.cloudflare.com.
    ```
    

---

### **DNS Failover and Load Balancing**

- **DNS Failover:**  
    Configured using multiple `A` or `CNAME` records and leveraging health checks.  
    Example:
    
    ```dns
    www.suhesh.com.np. IN A 192.0.2.1
    www.suhesh.com.np. IN A 192.0.2.2
    ```
    
    If `192.0.2.1` is down, traffic shifts to `192.0.2.2`.
    
- **Load Balancing:**  
    Uses RRSETs with multiple records for load sharing across servers.  
    Cloudflare and other DNS providers often implement this alongside traffic routing policies.
    

---

### **Reverse DNS (rDNS)**

- **Purpose:**  
    Maps IP addresses to domain names, often for verification purposes (like email authentication).
    
- **Example of a PTR Record:**
    
    ```dns
    1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa. IN PTR suhesh.com.np.
    ```
    
- **Key Use Cases:**
    
    - Email services check PTR records for spam prevention.
    - Provides more context in logs for troubleshooting.

---

### **Root Hints**

- **Definition:**  
    Root hints are the list of IP addresses of the root DNS servers, hard-coded into most DNS servers.
    
- **Use:**  
    These servers guide resolvers to TLD nameservers. If your DNS server doesn‚Äôt have a cache, it refers to root hints for direction.
    

---

### **Split-Horizon DNS**

- **What Is It?**  
    A DNS configuration that serves different results based on the source of the DNS query (e.g., internal vs. external users).
    
- **Example Use Case:**
    
    - Internal users: Resolve `suhesh.com.np` to `192.168.0.1` (internal IP).
    - External users: Resolve `suhesh.com.np` to `203.0.113.1` (public IP).
