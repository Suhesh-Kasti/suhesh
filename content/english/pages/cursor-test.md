# Custom Cursor Test

This page demonstrates the custom cursor implementation that follows both dark and light modes and interacts with elements on the website.

{{< cursor-test >}}

## How It Works

The custom cursor is implemented using CSS and JavaScript:

1. The cursor is a circular element that follows your mouse movement
2. It changes appearance when hovering over links, buttons, and images
3. It adapts to both dark and light modes automatically
4. It has special effects for mouse down events
5. It's disabled on touch devices for better mobile experience

Try switching between dark and light mode to see how the cursor adapts!
